# TO-DO List for Beam Solver Module development:

## Learning Phase:
1. Learn well about Matplotlib library (Done)
2. Learn about NumPy (Ongoing)
3. Larn about SciPy (or other fast python moudle that allows calculus operations)
4. A catchy name for the project to be figured out.

## Development:

#### Working Program Phase (initial goal)
1. Beam Class
2. Load Class
3. PointLoad, UDL, UVL subclasses
4. Reaction Class
5. R_x, R_y, M
 
#### Module Developement: Final Goal
- *to be roadmapped*
